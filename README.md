# E-shop.gr_on_steroids   
This is a Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script writen in Javascript.   
It's main functionality is to make my life easier (and maybe yours too) by showing ratings and comments without having to open each product page individualy on Greek eshop site e-shop.gr.  
  
-Shows average product rating next to the product listing.  
-Mouse over the rating to show number of ratings and user comments.  
-Press "s" to search!  
-Some visual upgrades.

Code quality unfortunatelly plain sucks, because at the time so did my coding skills :P  
Maybe will spend time to refactor it at some point when it breaks.
