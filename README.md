# E-shop.gr_on_steroids
This is a Greasemonkey script. It's main functionality is to make my life easier by showing reviews without having to open each product page individualy on Greek eshop site e-shop.gr.(Demo here:http://83.212.125.86/images/demo.jpg)

Some other features were added later and more will be added if asked.


-Shows average product rating next to the product listing.  
-Mouse over the rating to show number of ratings and user comments.  
-Added shortcut key "s" to show search, or you can click the magnifying glass on the top right instead.  
-Removed several annoying adds.
